I used a switch statement with cases recognizing the ascii values for each pitch class, then set it to print of the corresponding integer interval. I would like to know how to do this with accidentals, as the cases had to be integers, not chars, so I don't know how to do that yet.

I declared the number of samples variable nsamps to be 1000, then had a twopi variable that represents 2pi radians. angleincr divides the two, and the sine amplitude is found by taking the sin function of that angleincr. I put that inside of a forloop to generate all 1000 amplitude values.

This was a tough one for me. I was trying to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes rule of finding primes, where I remove primes systematically by removing all the multiples of each number starting from two until the square root of the highest square that can fit inside the target number. In this case it's 1000, so 961, sqrt(961) is 31, so that would be the toplimit variable. The dataarray variable stores 1 or 0 values for each number, and zero is assigned using the j forloop at line 19 to any multiple generated by numbers below the toplimit.
the checkPrimes function then prints all the numbers still holding a value of 1, which are the primes.
